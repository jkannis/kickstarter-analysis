# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project analyses the successes and failures of fundraising campaigns. Excel, Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts were used to filter, sort and combine data to present meaningful information for decision-making for the client.
### Purpose
The client for this analysis had a moderately successful fundraiser for a theater production. The goal of further analysis is to determine how different fundraising campaigns fared in relation to launch dates and fundraising goals. This report will show results and findings based on the dataset provided.
## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis was performed on the provided dataset using Excel. The data was sorted and filtered based on the client requests. There were challenges, such as extensive data that was unrelated to the client concern, as well as data that was provided in formats that required mainipulation and separation before analysis could begin.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first snapshot of information is Outcomes Based on Launch Date to help the client determine the best timeframe to begin future fundraising projects.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second snapshot of information is Outcomes Based on Goals to help the client determine a realistic fundraising goal for a successful project.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were challenges related to preparing this data for analysis. Calculating the dates from the timestamp was not overly difficult with the functions provided, but could skew results if not handled properly. For example, if the date was not calculated properly from the timestamp then the year functionality could potentially be way off, which in turn would alter the chart used for providing analysis to the client.

## Results
- Conclusions that can be drawn about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
    1. May is the most successful month for launching a theater project.
    2. December success and failure rates for launch are very similar, which means December could be a risky launch month.

- Based on the Outcomes Based on Goals data provided, he highest positive gap between percent successful and percent failed occurred at the less than 1000 goal, which was also the highest percent successful overall. Outside of this category, the most successful campaigns were in the 35k to 45k fundraising goal range.

- Some limitations of this dataset are the lack of recent data, details about the staff pick and backers information, and what the spotlight determination meant. More recent data would provide valuable information to the client regarding imminent projects. The other categories mentioned could provide information to guide how the client markets the project or who are the most important supporters to contact.

- Other graphs to consider for additional analysis might be a representation of the length of time for a fundraiser. It is possible that a longer fundraiser would have a higher probability of reaching the goal. Another aspect that might be considered is how the Staff Pick or Backers categories affected the success or failure rates.
